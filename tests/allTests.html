 * This javascript was created according to the specifications at
 * http://todotxt.com/ and is intended to allow users to access their
 * todo.txt files in a user-friendly and easy to visualize manner.
 *
 * Once initially uploaded, the todo.txt file will
 * be loaded into an HTML5 localStorage and managed from there.
 * The web page then allows downloading changes back to the user
 * in a txt format compliant with the todo.txt specifications, but
 * having re-sorted the tasks.
